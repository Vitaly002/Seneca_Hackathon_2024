# 2024 Seneca Hackathon

## Challenge Set: Student Housing

### Team Name: Muchachos

### Project Overview

In this hackathon, our team, **Muchachos**, adopted a **Hybrid Methodology** that effectively combined structured planning with flexibility to address the challenge of optimizing commuting solutions for students. Initially focused on analyzing housing rent fees across Canada, we pivoted to tackle a more nuanced challenge: optimizing commuting solutions for students at Seneca College. Our idea was to enhance an existing solution, the Seneca shuttle bus service, by expanding its reach to underserved neighborhoods.

### Objectives

- **Research Focus**: Investigate distances between Seneca College’s main campus (Newnham) and student-populated neighborhoods significantly far from the campus. Successful outcomes from this project could lead to expanding our research to include other Seneca campuses.
- **Goal**: Identify how expanding Seneca’s shuttle bus routes to these neighborhoods could reduce student's commuting time and expenses. The Seneca OneCard system, currently used in the cafeteria, was proposed to verify student identities and ensure that the shuttle service benefits only Seneca students.

### Methodology

#### Hybrid Approach

Our project utilized a **Hybrid Methodology**, integrating both Agile and Waterfall principles:

1. **Research Phase**:
   - **Data Collection**: Gathered data on rental fees and shuttle bus operation costs.
   - **Neighborhood Analysis**: Focused on student-populated areas considerably far from the Newnham campus.

2. **Analysis Phase**:
   - **Distance Analysis**: Evaluated distances between the Newnham campus and eight key neighborhoods: Markham, North York, Brampton, Etobicoke, Hamilton, Mississauga, Scarborough, and Vaughan.
   - **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Assessed how expanding shuttle bus routes to these neighborhoods could impact student commuting times and expenses.

3. **Implementation Phase**:
   - **Effective Routes**: Designed three different shuttle bus routes tailored to different times of the day—morning, afternoon, and evening—to optimize commuting experiences.
   - **Shuttle Bus Stops**: Planned stops at popular neighborhood destinations, including Markham's Pacific Mall, Vaughan Mills, Mississauga's Square One Shopping Centre, Scarborough Town Centre etc. These locations were chosen to enhance convenience for students and to create mutually beneficial partnerships like advertising campaigns, showcasing Seneca College's shuttle service benefits and increasing visibility in high-traffic areas.
   - **Data Visualization**: Presented findings using data visualization techniques to illustrate the potential benefits of the proposed shuttle routes.
   - **Presentation Development**: Created comprehensive presentations to effectively communicate our findings and recommendations.

#### Agile Methodologies

We employed Agile methodologies to enhance our project’s responsiveness and adaptability:

- **Iterative Development**: Regularly reviewed and adjusted our approach based on new insights and feedback.
- **Collaborative Work**: Conducted frequent team meetings and updates to ensure alignment and effective collaboration.
- **Feedback Integration**: Adapted our strategies based on continuous feedback and emerging data.

### Team Members

- **Roy Bryan David Franck Mariscal**: Team Leader
- **Tien Vu To**: Data Research & Analysis
- **Heungbin Oh**: Data Research & Analysis
- **Aditya Tambe**: PPT & Data Research
- **Krish Sanjaybhai Patel**: PPT & Data Research

### Activities Performed

- **Research**: Investigated rental fees, shuttle bus operation costs, and identified optimal neighborhoods for service expansion.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzed commuting patterns and evaluated the impact of proposed shuttle bus routes, including three time-specific routes and strategic stop locations.
- **Presentation**: Developed a detailed presentation to showcase our findings and the potential benefits of our recommendations.

### Conclusion

Our research-driven approach and agile methodology enabled us to successfully adapt and refine our project, leading us to the finals of the hackathon. By focusing on student-populated neighborhoods far from the Newnham campus, we demonstrated how targeted shuttle bus expansions could significantly improve student commuting efficiency and reduce associated costs.

### Real-World Context

The issue of high commuting costs is a pressing reality for many students. For instance, some students at UBC find it cheaper to fly from Calgary to Vancouver than to live in the city. This example underscores the real and significant challenge that our project addresses: reducing commuting expenses and improving accessibility for students.
